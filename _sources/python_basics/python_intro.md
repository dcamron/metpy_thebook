# Python Basics

This section will cover some basic fundamental aspects to the Python
programming language to make reading and writing code that comes
later in this book easier to understand and use. This is NOT a
comprehensive introduction to the language and all of details of how
it works. We'll cover only what is really needed and is more intended
as a reference section. We'll cover the following concepts:
* Setting variables
* Basic Mathematical Operators
* Lists, Tuples, Dictionary, and Array Object Types
* Slicing of list, tuples, and array objects
* Datetime Module
* Program Control Elements
  - If/Then Statements
  - Looping
* Creating and running Python scripts
  - Interactive scripting
  - Using arguments
