# Python Program Control Flow

So far we have learned computer programming that only works in a linear fashion.
There are times when we may want to only have a program do certain tasks under
certain conditions or do things repetitively with small variations. These programatic
elements enhance our ability to make Python scripts that work for a wider array
of circumstances. In this chapter we'll look at using if statements and looping to
control the flow of Python scripts.
