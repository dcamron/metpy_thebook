# Satellite Feature Identification

The entire atmosphere is connected through the temperature and pressure
distribution. Changes in the local distribution of temperature can lead
to dramatic changes in the structure of the atmosphere, including where
we observe strong winds aloft. These areas of strong wind aloft are
known as *jet streams* and they arise due to the temperature differences
created between tropical and polar regions in each hemisphere (thermal
wind balance). These fast-moving regions of air are a large driver of
the speed and motion of mid-latitude cyclones. Therefore, it is
important to be able to adequately identify jet streams on upper-level
maps as well as satellite images. This section will introduce you to the
basic concepts behind jet streams (and fronts to some extent) and how to
identify them using satellite imagery.

## Jet Streams
There are two main jet streams that affect the North American continent,
the polar and subtropical jet streams. The polar jet stream is the
northern branch of strong westerly winds aloft and the subtropical jet
stream is semi-constant jet stream that straddles with hemisphere around
25--30Â°N/S. Our main focus will be on the development and identification
of the polar jet stream.

A jet stream is the result of the integrated temperature gradient of the
atmosphere. Where we observe strong gradients (differences) in
temperature at lower-levels of the atmosphere, there will be an area of
strong winds aloft. This is a result of the atmosphere being maintained
in *thermal wind balance*, and thus is the explanation for why we have
strong winds aloft. Thermal wind balance states that where there are
strong temperature gradients in the lower atmosphere, winds will
increase with height up to the top of the troposphere (i.e., the
tropopause). Inherently this means that where there are jet streams
aloft, there are likely fronts at the surface (where the strong
temperature gradients are). This links our jets to being key in the
evolution of our mid-latitude cyclones.

Jet streams travel with the location of temperature gradients from
winter to summer and back again. The strongest temperature gradients
over North America occur during the winter months, December, January,
and February. The temperature gradient is also at its southernmost
extent. Therefore, the jet stream is at its strongest and located on
average over the southern half of the United States. As the atmosphere
transitions from winter to spring and then to summer, the temperature
gradient treks northward and decreases in intensity. This moves the jet
stream northward and weakens the overall speed, on average.

On an upper-level map (e.g., 300 hPa) it is rather easy to identify the
region of strongest wind by inspecting the plotted wind barbs or
contours of wind speed at the level. However, the Earth is primarily
covered by our vast oceans where we do not regularly obtain *in situ*
upper-level or surface observations, therefore we must use other tools
for identifying the regions of strong winds aloft.

## Jet Stream Identification

The most useful satellite image for identifying upper-level flow
patterns is the water vapor imagery. Water vapor is ubiquitous
throughout the atmosphere, meaning that there is some quantity of water
vapor at all times in all places in the atmosphere. This water vapor can
then be traced as it circulates within our weather systems around the
globe. For jet streams there is a distinct pattern that occurs within
water vapor imagery that makes it possible to identify the location of
intense jet streams.

Jet streams are located where there is a strong gradient (difference) in
moisture on water vapor imagery ({numref}`Fig. %s <wvjetstream>`).
This boundary is a result of circulations associated with the jet itself.
The jet stream is located parallel to the axis of the boundary as
illustrated in {numref}`Figure %s <wvjetstream>`.

A real example of a jet stream as observed in water vapor imagery is
given in {numref}`Figure %s <wvjetexample>`. The main part of the jet stream is located across
central California into central Nevada. The sharp boundary in the water
vapor imagery indicates southern boundary of the strongest part of the
jet stream. Note the contours of wind speed and how they are oriented
parallel to that boundary. This real-life example is a cross between the
schematic image in {numref}`Figure %s <wvjetstream>` and {numref}`%s <wvcyclone>`.

Additionally, a mature mid-latitude cyclone will exhibit the shape of a
comma ({numref}`Figure %s <wvcyclone>`). This is the result of airflow
through a mid-latitude cyclone. Identifying the stage of cyclone development
is key to being able to forecast well in a data sparse region. The use of
satellites to identify important features about the mid-latitude cyclone will aid in
making a good forecast.

## Wave Pattern

The upper atmosphere is also marked by the wavy pattern of troughs and
ridges that is the result of a differentially heated, rotating planet.
These waves (a trough/ridge combination) is called a Rossby wave, after
the 20^th^ century atmospheric scientist Carl Gustav-Rossby who
identified the reason for the wavy pattern. Water vapor can also be used
to identify these troughs and ridges by detecting cyclonic
(counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere) and anticyclonic
(clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere) spin (vorticity) within the
motions of the water vapor at upper-levels (Fig. 4).
