# Satellite Observations

So far we have been building our Python skill set by plotting surface
data, upper-air data, model output, and Skew-Ts. We have created
new variables to plot and plotted variables already in the data files.
Now we have the opportunity two explore some other types of weather
data, such as soundings, radar, and satellite-derived variables. In
this chapter we'll review some aspects about satellite orbits, types of
satellite, and then expand your knowledge about the use of satellite
imagery involving the analysis of atmospheric phenomena, such as jet
streams. In a separate lab, you'll learn more about creating satellite
images using Python.
