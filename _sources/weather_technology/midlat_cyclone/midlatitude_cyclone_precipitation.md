# Precipitation

Not only does a mid-latitude cyclone potentially bring great changes in
temperature for a region, it can also produce copious amounts of
precipitation. Depending on your location within the cyclone's path
comes a variety of different precipitation characteristics. Not only the
amount of precipitation that falls, but the way it falls will determine
whether it is beneficial or detrimental to an area.

Before we can get precipitation associated with a mid-latitude cyclone
we must first get clouds. There are three main components needed to get
cloud formation: (1) cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), (2) a source of
moisture, and (3) a source of lift. Generally, there is always plenty of
CCN, but without ample moisture, no amount of lift will allow a parcel
of air to reach saturation and thus form a cloud.

For precipitation we need these cloud formation processes to continue
for some time, such that the droplets (or ice crystals) within our
clouds continue to grow. This usually requires added moisture and more
lift. The main source of moisture for weather systems in the
upper-Midwest is the Gulf of Mexico with the main source of lift
associated with our cyclone are the frontal surfaces. The different
styles of lift often lead to very different precipitation
characteristics.
