# Pre-Environment Stage

Most cyclones form over an area that has at least some kind of surface
temperature gradient. As you will learn about later in your meteorology
coursework, a surface temperature gradient is not absolutely needed to
form a cyclone. However, cyclones will preferentially form over regions
that have some weak temperature gradient, as it is easier for the
atmosphere to concentrate a weak temperature gradient rather than
forming a temperature gradient where there was none.

The pre-environment stage is defined by a weak temperature gradient (if
one exists at all), where there may or may not be defined a stationary
boundary ({numref}`Fig. %s <preenv>`). In general, there is little temperature advection
near the surface and only a small depression of lower pressure. In
general, there is also a moisture gradient between the two different
airmasses. In the Northern Hemisphere to the north is the dry
continental airmass and to the south the moist tropical airmass.

Associated with the temperature gradient at the surface there is a need
for an upper-level trough to initiate the cyclogenesis stage
({numref}`Fig. %s <preenv>`).
This additional requirement differs from the classic Norwegian Cyclone
Model (NCM) because of now having upper-level observations. The
upper-level trough will initiate appropriate divergence and subsequent
rising motion to the *east* of the trough axis. This will eventually
result in less mass within the column, which will mean the surface
pressure will decrease, initiating our mid-latitude cyclone.
