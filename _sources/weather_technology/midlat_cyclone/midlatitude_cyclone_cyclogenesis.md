# Cyclogenesis Stage

For cyclogenesis to occur at the surface, a wave in the upper-levels
must come along to provide the necessary support to strengthen the
low-level temperature gradient. This stage is signified by an increasing
temperature gradient, the beginning of cyclonic flow at the surface, and
a small decrease in the mean sea-level pressure
({numref}`Fig. %s <cyclogenesis>`). There are now
fronts defined with a warm front typically east of the cyclone center
and a cold front south and west of the cyclone center. The pressure
troughs in association with the fronts begin to develop.

As the initial cyclone begins to develop, the trough begins to intensify
simultaneously. The intensification results from the different
temperature advection surrounding the mid-latitude cyclone. The 500-hPa
pattern strengthens ({numref}`Fig. %s <cyclogenesis>`) along
with the surface cyclone and is evidenced by the deepening of the
upper-level trough. Additionally, a typical mid-latitude cyclone
exhibits a tilt with height. The typical tilt is where the upper-level
trough (e.g., the 500-hPa trough) is located *to the west* of the
surface mid-latitude cyclone ({numref}`Fig. %s <cyclogenesis>`).
This *westward tilt* with height is essential to the continued
strengthening of the mid-latitude cyclone.
