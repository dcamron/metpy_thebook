# Occlusion

Near the end of the life cycle of a mid-latitude cyclone the cold air
that has been on only the north side of the cyclone will now wrap
completely around the center of the circulation ({numref}`Fig. %s <mature>`). This, in
effect, cuts off the cyclone from the moist, tropical airmass that has
been bringing energy into the system. This process is called occlusion
(e.g., cyclone wrap-up). A result of the occlusion processes the cold
front and warm front meet and the remaining wind shift (and possibly
slight temperature gradient) can be defined an occluded front. At this
point the cyclone may dissipate or form a new low-pressure center at the
triple point of the cold front, warm front, and occluded front.

Typically, around the time that there is no longer a westward tilt of
the cyclone with height the surface system will occlude ({numref}`Fig. %s <mature>`). The
cyclone is said to be vertically stacked at this point. Depending on the
orientation of the cyclone, redevelopment may be possible at the triple
point of the cold, warm, and occluded fronts. The redevelopment occurs
frequently with storm systems, but eventually all systems will dissipate
after an occlusion.
