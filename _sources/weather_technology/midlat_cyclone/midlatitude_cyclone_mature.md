# Mature Stage

The natural tendency for cyclones is to intensify (reduced surface mean
sea-level pressure) due to the interaction between low-level temperature
advection and upper-level troughs. As the cyclone matures, the
temperature gradient will strengthen, the mean sea-level pressure will
lower, and wind speeds will in general increase ({numref}`Fig. %s <mature>`).

During the mature stage our fronts will have the clearest definition
through a combination of the temperature structure and wind shift being
co-located ({numref}`Fig. %s <mature>`). The cyclone will be moving roughly along the
direction of the isotherms to the east of the cyclone center.

At 500 hPa, the trough has intensified further ({numref}`Fig. %s <mature>`). This dual
intensification of the surface and upper-level pattern is called the
*self-development paradigm*. If the surface (or near-surface) cyclone is
positioned to the east of the upper-level trough, then the surface
cyclone will continue to intensify. The overall tilt has decreased
somewhat between the cyclogenesis and mature phase of the cyclone's life
cycle. However, some continued development would be expected with this
orientation of surface and upper-level patterns.
