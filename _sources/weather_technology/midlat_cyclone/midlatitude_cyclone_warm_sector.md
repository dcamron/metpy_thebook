# Warm Sector Rain

In the warm sector of a cyclone there is typically more than ample
moisture for clouds and precipitation, however, the lack of a clear
lifting mechanism is often the limiting factor. Depending on the time of
year there could be some upper-level support for causing air parcels to
rise, thus initiating convective precipitation. Generally, precipitating
systems in the warm sector move through areas quickly, possibly
inundating an area with heavy rainfall.
