# Warm Front

The gradual slope of the warm front in the lowest layers of the
atmosphere enables a slow general lift of airstreams, which sustain a
slow, but steady bout of precipitation poleward of the warm front. If
the air is cold enough throughout the column, frozen or mixed
precipitation is possible ({numref}`Fig. %s <cfront>`).
These characteristics hold for any area north
of the track of the cyclone.
