# Cold Front Precipitation

The abrupt nose of the cold air in the lowest levels of the atmosphere
can act to forcibly lift portions of the warm sector airstreams
({numref}`Fig. %s <cfront>`). This abrupt lift often initiates
convective precipitation, which is typically intense. However, due
to the generally rapid movement of the front, the
heavy precipitation will move through quickly.
