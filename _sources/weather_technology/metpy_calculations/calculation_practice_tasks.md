# Practice Tasks - MetPy Calculations
1.  Compute the potential temperature on the 850-hPa surface from GFS
    output, add the dewpoint values to the dataset, and plot over the
    CONUS.

2.  Compute the dewpoint temperature for 850-hPa from GFS output using
    the temperature and relative humidity, add the dewpoint values to
    the dataset, and plot over the CONUS.

3.  Compute the heat index of the 2-m temperature output from the GFS
    (you'll need both temperature and relative humidity at 2 m), add it
    to the dataset, and plot over a local region of your choosing.
