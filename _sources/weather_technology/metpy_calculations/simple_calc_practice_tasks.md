# Practice Tasks - Simple Calculations

1.  Create a model representation of a three-hour change in surface (2m)
    temperature.

2.  Create a map with mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) and 1000-500 hPa
    thickness. Contour MSLP in black and 1000-500 hPa in dashed red.

3.  Plot a 500-hPa map for today and plot geopotential height and
    absolute vorticity from the GFS output.
