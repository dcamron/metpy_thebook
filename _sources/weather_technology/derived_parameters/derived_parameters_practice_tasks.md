# Practice Tasks - Derived Parameters

1.  Select one (or more) of the following websites (or choose your own)
    and navigate through to explore maps on vorticity (typically shown
    at 500 hPa) and temperature advection (at 850 hPa). Explore patterns
    relative to features such as upper-level troughs and mid-latitude
    cyclones. What relationships do you see in real-time forecast
    models?

    b.  <https://www.pivotalweather.com/model.php>

2.  Use a map of 500 mb vorticity from the most recent NAM forecast
    model to practice analyzing areas of *cyclonic* vorticity advection
    (CVA) as well as *anticyclonic* vorticity advection (AVA). Do you
    seem to find regions of CVA *ahead of* or *in the wake of*
    upper-level troughs?

3.  Consider the following image -- where is the 1000-500 hPa thickness
    high (and where is it low). How does this coincide with the surface
    low across the Plains? Where might you expect to find an upper-level
    trough (and ridge)?
