# Vorticity

Another variable that meteorologists commonly use is the amount of local
spin in the atmosphere or vorticity. There are two primary components of
vorticity: relative vorticity and Earth's vorticity. Earth's vorticity
we have already talked about in terms of the
[Coriolis parameter](../atmospheric_forces/coriolis_force.md). The
relative vorticity is calculated using the following equation in algebraic form:

$$
\text{vorticity} = \zeta = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta x} - \frac{\Delta u}{\Delta y}
$$

Absolute vorticity is the relative vorticity plus Earth's vorticity.

$$
\text{Absolute Vorticity} = \eta = \zeta + f 
$$
Earth's vorticity, $f$, is simply the Coriolis parameter
($f = 2\Omega\sin{\phi)}$, where $\phi$ is the latitude.

Displaying the relative or absolute vorticity helps to identify troughs
and ridges and will be important to diagnosing vertical motions in
dynamic and synoptic meteorology. Many meteorological phenomena are
rotating systems, which will all have varying degrees of vorticity.
