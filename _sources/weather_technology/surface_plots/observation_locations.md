# Station Model Location Details

The layout of data around a station model is very important. At the
beginning of this section we reviewed the typical layout for the display
of meteorological variables around a surface station. In our plotting of
surface observations ([`PlotObs`](../../appendix/metpy_declarative_plotobs)) we can set everything in the same way.
The following is the location where a variable will be placed ({numref}`Fig. %s <locations>`), depending
on the string at each location.

station model using MetPy `PlotObs`.

The default location is C.

1.  What variable should be plotted with the location of C (center)?

2.  What about the W (west) location?

3.  What about for a station model that you wanted to plot: temperature,
    dewpoint, mslp, current weather, and visibility?

Now let's work to plot a full suite of observation information for multiple stations.
