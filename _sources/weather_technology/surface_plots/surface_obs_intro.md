# Surface Obs and Plotting

**Surface Data**

The most basic of atmospheric measurements started at the surface.
Before the advent of instruments like the thermometer and barometer
(yes; there were times when we didn't have these basic instruments),
people recorded whether the weather was warm or cold. Unfortunately,
humans can only detect a minimum change in temperature of around 5Â°F.
Since we live on Earth's surface, it is easiest to get our measurements
there. But the more important question may be, what variables are
important and *why*?

What do you think are the most important surface variables and why?

A goal for every meteorologist is to be able to explain the variations
in atmospheric parameters that we observe. In this section we will focus on the
surface variables and their spatial variation. There are many variables
that are important and we have to somehow get all of them plotted on a
single map, for multiple stations. Doing so will benefit a meteorologist
immensely because there will be a wealth of information literally at
their fingertips. The following section describes how we can compactly
write the surface data in a concise format on a weather map.
