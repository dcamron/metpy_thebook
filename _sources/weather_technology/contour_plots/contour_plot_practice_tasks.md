# Practice Tasks - Contour Plotting
1.	Create a 500-hPa map with height contoured in solid black
    and temperature in Kelvin contoured in dashed red.
2.	Add winds to your map.
3.	Create a map that contains derived “surface” quantities from
    the model with mean sea-level pressure in solid black, and temperature
    in Fahrenheit in dashed red. (You’ll need to convert the temperatures
    to the appropriate scale, which would work similarly to what
    we did for surface observation plots.)
4.	Make other maps with a variety of variables being plotted.
