# Practice Tasks - MetPy Sounding Calculations

1.  Plot a sounding with a surface parcel profile for a different day.
    Note: most sites only have soundings available at 00 and 12 UTC,
    when radiosondes are regularly launched. However, there are times
    when special launches are conducted on interesting weather days and
    you might have an 18 or 21 UTC sounding, but those are rare.

2.  Calculate the level of free convection (LFC) and equilibrium level
    (EL) and plot on a skew-T.

3.  Shade CAPE and CIN areas; see the example from MetPy for help
