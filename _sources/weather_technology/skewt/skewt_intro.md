# Skew-T Log-p Diagram

Taking a deviation away from plotting data on two-dimensional maps, here we look
to plot vertical profile data to understand aspects of the atmosphere that
are important to stability, precipitation, and precipitation type. There
are a number of different thermodynamic diagrams that are used in
the sciences and engineering. In meteorology, these diagrams are used to
plot a variety of different atmospheric parameters, all in a standard,
easily accessible format and are used extensively in forecasting. In a
number of ways they can be used to assess the vertical structure and stability of
the atmosphere. The vertical profiles of temperature, dew-point
temperature, and wind speed and direction can explain a lot about the
nature of atmosphere and what types of weather may form in such an
environment.

The data displayed in these diagrams are collected by radiosondes, which
are instrumented platform with meteorological sensors and a radio
transmitter that are carried aloft by a balloon. Radiosondes are
released at selected NWS sites across the country at 0000 and 1200 UTC
every day, as well as from sites around the world. Sometimes special
radiosondes are released at 1800 UTC (or other times) on days when the
risk of severe weather is especially high.

Stability is an important concept for understanding many atmospheric
processes, but how can we assess the stability? The vertical stability
of the atmosphere is determined by the vertical distribution of
temperature, pressure, and wind speed and direction. These measurements
are obtained by launching radiosondes with a big balloon. In this lab we
will first review stability terminology and then discuss how we can plot
our variables in a helpful fashion.
