# Skew-T Parcel Path

Skew-T diagrams are filled with lots of information; this part will
introduce you to a few concepts related to stability that can be
analyzed from an atmospheric sounding plotted on a skew-T diagram.

## Drawing a Parcel Path

To draw a parcel path, you must first determine the lifting condensation
level (LCL). In previous courses you did this through assuming a DALR
and WALR, now we will use the skew-T/log-p diagram. The LCL is where
cloud bases will form and thus the point of initial saturation in the
atmospheric column.

## Lifting Condensation Level (LCL)

Definition: The height at which a parcel of air lifted dry
adiabatically would become saturated. The LCL is always found at or
below the CCL.

Procedure: Follow the saturation mixing ratio line from the surface
dew-point and the dry adiabat from the surface temperature upward
until they intersect.

Once the LCL is determined, then the parcel path can be drawn. Starting
the surface parcel at the temperature of the surface and following the
dry adiabat line up until you reach the LCL, then lift the parcel via
the moist adiabatic line. (If you are not directly on a dry or moist
adiabat, then follow parallel to the lines on either side of the parcel
path.)

As the result of drawing in the parcel path two other important levels
are identified. The Level of Free Convection (LFC ) and the Equilibrium
Level (EL).

## Level of Free Convection (LFC)

Definition: The level at which a parcel of air lifted dry
adiabatically until saturated (LCL), then moist adiabatically becomes
*warmer* than its environment.

Procedure: Find the LCL and then follow the moist adiabat upward until
it intersects the temperature sounding. This is the LFC.

```{note}
Be careful when the LFC is below a sharp inversion. Ideally, one
should continue to follow the moist adiabat through the inversion to
determine the LFC.
```

## Equilibrium Level (EL)

Definition: The level at which a parcel of air lifted moist
adiabatically from the LFC becomes *cooler* than its environment. This
is an estimate of the cloud height of convective type clouds.

Procedure: Find the LFC, then follow the moist adiabat upward until it
intersects the temperature sounding. This is the EL.

When the parcel path is to the right of the environmental temperature
profile, the parcel is unstable and would want to rise. When it is to
the left of the environmental temperature profile the parcel is stable
and would want to sink. If the parcel is stable in the lowest layers
(i.e., the level below the LFC) then the atmosphere must force parcels
to rise in order for the parcel to become unstable and realize any
instability that might be present in the Earth-atmosphere system.
