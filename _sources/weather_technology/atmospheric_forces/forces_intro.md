# Atmospheric Forces

In this chapter you will be introduced to the forces
governing atmospheric motions that will be important for describing 
important for synoptic scale motions with force balances. A common theme
throughout all of meteorology is balance. The non-uniform heating from
the sun across Earth's surface creates an imbalance in temperature,
which creates a localized difference in pressure. The atmosphere does
not like the imbalance (in temperature or pressure or anything), so the
reaction is to undo the temperature/pressure difference. This is where
we get weather from, an attempt to regain balance in the atmosphere.
Luckily, the atmosphere is never able to achieve the balance (because it
is always being pulled out of balance) otherwise we wouldn't have
anything to forecast!
