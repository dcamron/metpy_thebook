# Friction Force

Close to the surface there are many things blocking the flow of air from
high to low pressure, such as trees, buildings, mountains, etc. We term
this force, friction, and it always acts to slow the wind. Friction can
be written algebraically as,

$$
FF = -kV
$$

where $k$ represents the coefficient related to the roughness of Earth's
surface and will vary depending on the characteristics of the surface
and has units of $s^{-1}$. Again, the units will be $m$ $s^{-2}$.
