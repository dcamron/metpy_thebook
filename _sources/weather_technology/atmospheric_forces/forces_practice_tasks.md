# Practice Tasks - Forces

Given the following 300-hPa map ({numref}`Fig. %s <geohght300>`), answer the following questions:
```{figure} ../../images/geopotential_heights_300hPa_2018041112.png
:alt: 300-hPa Geopotential Height Map

This map shows 300-hPa heights in solid black contours for 11 April 2018 at 12 UTC.
```
  1. Describe geographically where the strongest height gradient is located.
  2. Over what state(s) would the centrifugal force be the strongest. Explain your choice.
  3. Would friction play a large role in slowing the winds down at this level? Explain.
  4. Would the Coriolis Force be greater over South Dakota or Indiana under the conditions
     depicted on the map? Explain.
