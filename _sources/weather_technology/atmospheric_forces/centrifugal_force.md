# Centrifugal Force

If the flow is curved, as in troughs and ridges, another force must be
considered, the centrifugal force (CENTF). This force is also known as
the centripetal acceleration. The centrifugal force acts to push outward
from the center of the turn. For example, if you are in a car and take a
corner holding constant speed, you will feel like you are being pushed
away from the turn, that is the centrifugal force at work. The
centrifugal force can be written in algebraic form as,

$$
CENTF = \frac{V^2}{R}
$$

where $R$ is the radius of curvature. The radius of curvature, $R$, is
positive for cyclones and negative for anticyclones in the Northern
Hemisphere. Therefore, in low pressure, the centrifugal force acts
opposite the direction of the PGF, but in high pressure it acts in the
same direction. Again, unit analysis indicates that the centrifugal
force has the same units as PGF and CF and is $m$ $s^{-2}$.
