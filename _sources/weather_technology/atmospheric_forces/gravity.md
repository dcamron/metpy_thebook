# Gravity

Finally, the last force to consider is the gravitational force. It's not
only a good idea, but also the law! Gravity always acts downward and
keeps things from accelerating in the vertical and is assumed to equal
$9.81$ $m$ $s^{-2}$.

All of these forces can now be combined into a number of different force
balances, which can explain a large number of different flows in the
atmosphere. We will consider these force balances and the assumptions
that form these atmospheric balances during a later class period.
