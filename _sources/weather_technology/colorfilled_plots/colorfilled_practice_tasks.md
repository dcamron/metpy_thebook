# Practice Tasks - Color-filled Plotting

1.  Create a 500-hPa map with height contoured in solid black, and
    temperature in Celsius in color-filled contours.

2.  Add winds to your map.

3.  Create a map 850-hPa geopotential heights in solid black and temperature
    in Celsius color filled. (You'll need to convert the temperatures
    to the appropriate scale, which would work similarly to what we did
    for the example color-filled plot.)

4.  Make the above map, but use `RasterPlot` instead.
