# Thermal Wind Balance

The thermal wind is a combination of the hydrostatic balance and
geostrophic balance and explains why winds typically intensify with
increasing height (stronger winds from the west) in the mid-latitude
regions ({numref}`Fig. %s <thermalwind>`). This balance brings together
the relationship between temperature and winds. Cooler surface
temperatures mean a shorter vertical distance to a given pressure level,
whereas higher surface temperatures would mean a longer vertical distance
to a given pressure level. This results in strong pressure gradients aloft,
which is in association with the strong jet stream winds observed in the upper
troposphere.

Visualization of thermal wind balance where in the colder air pressure
decreases more reapidly that in warmer air creating a strong pressure
gradient force that increases with height and is maximuzed near the top
of the troposphere (near 300 hPa).
