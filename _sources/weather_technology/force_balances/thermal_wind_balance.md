# Thermal Wind Balance

The thermal wind is a combination of the hydrostatic balance and
geostrophic balance and explains why winds typically intensify with
increasing height (stronger winds from the west) in the mid-latitude
regions ({numref}`Fig. %s <thermalwind>`). This balance brings together
the relationship between temperature and winds. Cooler surface
temperatures mean a shorter vertical distance to a given pressure level,
whereas higher surface temperatures would mean a longer vertical distance
to a given pressure level. This results in strong pressure gradients aloft,
which is in association with the strong jet stream winds observed in the upper
troposphere.
