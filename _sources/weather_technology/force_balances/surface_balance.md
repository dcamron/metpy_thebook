# Guldberg-Mohn Balance (Surface Balance)

At and near the surface, friction begins to affect atmospheric flows by
slowing the wind. Because friction acts to slow the wind, the Coriolis
force subsequently does not turn the wind as much and therefore the wind
will flow across isobars. This is known as the Guldberg-Mohn force
balance and can be written algebraically as,

$$
0 = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta x} + f V - k U

0 = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta y} - f U - k V
$$

The greater the roughness of the surface, the stronger the friction,
the greater the angle that the flow will cross the isobars. In
{numref}`Figure %s <surfacebalance>` notice that near the center
of low pressure just north of Nova Scotia, CN, there are a number of
wind barbs that are crossing the isobars and heading into the low center.
The friction near the surface is causing the speed of the wind to slow down,
thus reducing the overall Coriolis force deflection and yielding a wind
that is not parallel to the isobars and ultimately goes into a low.
