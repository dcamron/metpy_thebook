# Guldberg-Mohn Balance (Surface Balance)

At and near the surface, friction begins to affect atmospheric flows by
slowing the wind. Because friction acts to slow the wind, the Coriolis
force subsequently does not turn the wind as much and therefore the wind
will flow across isobars. This is known as the Guldberg-Mohn force
balance and can be written algebraically as,

$$
0 = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta x} + f V - k U

0 = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta y} - f U - k V
$$

The greater the roughness of the surface, the more the flow will cross
the isobars.
