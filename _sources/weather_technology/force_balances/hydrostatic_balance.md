# Hydrostatic Balance

We begin with the hydrostatic balance, which is a force balance between
the vertical pressure gradient force and gravity. There is always a
vertical pressure gradient force and it is highest at the surface and
decreases exponentially with increasing altitude. This balance can be
written algebraically as,

$$
-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta z} = g
$$

On average, the atmosphere can be approximated to be in hydrostatic
balance (i.e., there is little vertical motion) as average vertical
motions are on the order of centimeters per second. However, there are
certain atmospheric phenomenon that 'violate' hydrostatic balance,
resulting in considerable vertical motion ($>1$ $m$ $s^{-1}$).

balance?<br><br><br><br>

Hydrostatic balance can also be visualized with a force balance diagram
({numref}`Fig. %s <hydrostatic>`) that depicts the different forces and
how they are acting on an air parcel in the vertical dimension.
