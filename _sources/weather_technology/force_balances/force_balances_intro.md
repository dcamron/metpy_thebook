# Atmospheric Force Balances

One way to describe the wind is to construct force balance diagrams to
visualize all of the different forces acting on a "parcel" of air. This
goes back to the Newtonian idea of force equaling mass times
acceleration:

$$
\vec{F} = m\vec{a}
$$

Where $\vec{F}$ is the force vector, $m$ is the mass in kg, and $\vec{a}$ is the
acceleration in $m$ $s^{-2}$. A force balance would mean that the sum of
forces acting on a particular body sum to zero. Therefore, a body in
balance will not be experiencing any acceleration,

$$
\frac{\sum \vec{F}}{m} = 0
$$

There are four main force balances that we will consider plus a 'balance
of balances'. The force balances presented here are: hydrostatic,
geostrophic, gradient, Guldberg-Mohn, and the thermal wind balance.
Between these balances we can describe most of the flows that occur in
the atmosphere, especially the horizontal wind that dominates most
atmospheric motion.

When talking about vectors, whether a force vector or a wind vector, it is
important to remember that they have both a magnitude and direction. This
is especially useful when thinking about explaining how the wind will blow.
Any vector can be broken down into its components from which the magnitude
(e.g., speed of the wind) and direction can be calculated.
