# Atmospheric Force Balances

One way to describe the wind is to construct force balance diagrams to
visualize all of the different forces acting on a "parcel" of air. This
goes back to the Newtonian idea of force equaling mass times
acceleration:

$$
\vec{F} = m\vec{a}
$$

Where $\vec{F}$ is the force vector, $m$ is the mass in kg, and $\vec{a}$ is the
acceleration in $m$ $s^{-2}$. A force balance would mean that the sum of
forces acting on a particular body sum to zero. Therefore, a body in
balance will not be experiencing any acceleration,

$$
\frac{\sum \vec{F}}{m} = 0
$$

There are four main force balances that we will consider plus a 'balance
of balances'. The force balances presented here are: hydrostatic,
geostrophic, gradient, Guldberg-Mohn, and the thermal wind balance.
Between these balances we can describe most of the flows that occur in
the atmosphere.
