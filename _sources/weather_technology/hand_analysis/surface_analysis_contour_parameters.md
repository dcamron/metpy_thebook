# Surface Maps Contour Parameters

We previously introduced hand analysis when we looked at the difference
between an isobaric (pressure) surface and a constant height surface. In
this lab you will complete a hand analysis of a surface map. The surface
map can be more difficult because we cannot use the same atmospheric
relationships, such as geostrophic or gradient wind balance, to aid in
the drawing contours at the surface. This is the result of need to
account for the friction that is present at and near the surface.
However, it is through the analysis of one-year worth of surface data
that the Bergen School was able to develop the early theories and life
cycles of mid-latitude cyclones.

**Surface Analysis**

Contouring is accomplished in just the same way as it would be for
upper-level maps, separating warmer air from colder air or higher
pressure from lower pressure. At the surface there are three main
parameters that re analyzed by contouring: mean sea-level pressure
(MSLP), temperature, and dewpoint temperature. The details of the
contours are summarized below and are also part of the initial handout
regarding map analysis.

## **Surface**
| Parameter | Contour Interval | Color | Style |
| - | - | - | - |
| Mean Sea Level Pressure (MSLP) | 4 mb centered on 1000 mb (e.g., 984, 988, 992, 996, 1000, 1004, 1008) | Black | Solid |
| Temperature | Every 10째F on the 10's or 5째C on the 10's and 5's | Red | Dashed |
| Dew Point | Every 10째F on the 10's or 5째C on the 10's and 5's | Green | Dashed |

*Shading on surface maps*:

Precipitation is shaded in *light green* pencil, fog in *yellow*. When
shading avoid a polka dot look when shading areas of precipitation.
Thunderstorm symbols should be circled in *red* pen. Occasionally, the
clear regions are delineated by scalloped *blue* lines.

There are additional features that are important to mark while analyzing
a surface map. Generally, you want to indicate areas of precipitation,
shading areas in light green. You may wish to differentiate different
precipitation types with different colors. For example, you might shade
snow in light blue, rain in light green, and mixed precipitation types
in pink. The shading is done to help the analyzer better understand the
current weather situation present on the map.
