# Upperair Map Contour Parameters

The tables below outlines the most common parameters to be contoured on a upperair maps
for 850, 700, 500, and 300 hPa.
Pay particular attention to the contour intervals at the different levels, which would
be good to commit to memory and should be used whether a human or a computer is drawing
the contour. In particular, pay close attention to the geopotential height parameter.

## **850 hPa**

| Parameter | Contour Interval | Color | Style |
| - | - | - | - |
| Height | 3 dm centered on 150 dm (e.g., 138, 141, 144, 147, 150, 153, 156) | Black | Solid |
| Temperature | Every 5°C on the 10's and 5's | Red | Dashed |
| Mixing Ratio | Every 2 g/kg | Green | Dashed |

_Shading on 850 hPa maps:_

Mixing ratio (or other moisture variable) can be shaded with progressively darker green
colors as the moisture content increases (e.g., higher values of mixing ratio).

## **700 hPa**

| Parameter | Contour Interval | Color | Style |
| - | - | - | - |
| Height | 3 dm centered on 300 dm (e.g., 288, 291, 294, 297, 300, 303, 306) | Black | Solid |
| Temperature | Every 5°C on the 10's and 5's | Red | Dashed |
| Dewpoint Depression | Every 5°C | Green | Dashed |

_Shading on 700 hPa maps:_

Dewpoint Depression (or other moisture variable) can be shaded with progressively
darker green colors as the moisture content increases (e.g., lower values of dewpoint depression).

## **500 hPa**

| Parameter | Contour Interval | Color | Style |
| - | - | - | - |
| Height | 6 dm centered on 540 dm (e.g., 528, 534, 540, 546, 552) | Black | Solid |
| Temperature | Every 5°C on the 10's and 5's | Red | Dashed |
| Wind Speed | Every 20 kts on the 10's starting at 30 kt (or)Every 10 m/s on the 5's starting at 25 m/s | Blue | Dashed |

_Shading on 500 hPa maps:_

Shade isotachs with progressively darker shades of blue to purple pencil beginning at 50 kt.
In other words, shade the area between the 50 and 70 knot isotach in light blue, between
70 and 90 knots in medium blue, from 90 to 110 knots in dark blue, between 110 and 130 knots
in light purple, and so on (analogously, 25-35 m/s, 35-45 m/s and 45-55 m/s, 55-65 m/s, etc.).
You may use orange (or some color other than blue or purple) for the strongest wind.

## **300 hPa**

| Parameter | Contour Interval | Color | Style |
| - | - | - | - |
| Height | 12 dm centered on 900 dm (e.g., 876, 888, 900, 912, 924) | Black | Solid |
| Temperature | Every 5°C on the 10's and 5's | Red | Dashed |
| Wind Speed | Every 20 kts on the 10's starting at 50 kt (or)Every 10 m/s on the 5's starting at 25 m/s | Blue | Dashed |

_Shading on 300 hPa maps:_

Shade isotachs with progressively darker shades of blue to purple pencil beginning at 50 kt.
In other words, shade the area between the 50 and 70 knot isotach in light blue, between
70 and 90 knots in medium blue, from 90 to 110 knots in dark blue, between 110 and 130 knots
in light purple, and so on (analogously, 25-35 m/s, 35-45 m/s and 45-55 m/s, 55-65 m/s, etc.).
You may use orange (or some color other than blue or purple) for the strongest wind.
