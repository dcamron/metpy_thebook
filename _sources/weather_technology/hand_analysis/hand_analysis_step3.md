# Step 3: Labeling contours

After drawing your contours and making them consistent you'll need to label
your contours appropriately.

-  Label your contours at both ends on the map boundaries according to
   the methodology appropriate for each field; leave a space to label
   closed contours.
-  Use decameters on upper-level maps (e.g., 5400 m is labeled 540)
-  Use two digits for pressure on surface maps (e.g., 1004 mb is
   labeled 04)
-  Label colors should correspond to match the contours coloring.
-  DO NOT PUT UNITS ON LABELS!
