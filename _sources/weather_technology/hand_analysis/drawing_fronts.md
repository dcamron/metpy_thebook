# Drawing Fronts

Identifying fronts is not a trivial task, yet they are fundamental parts
of our cyclone model since the time of {cite:t}`bjerknes_solberg_1922`.
Therefore, it is important to identify and correctly analyze the
location of fronts at the surface. There are times that a front will
practically jump off the map, but more often than not it will take time
to discern the actual location of a front. {cite:t}`SandersDoswell1995`
document well the difficulty of identifying fronts. For a given case
even experienced meteorologists will often disagree with the placement
of fronts. The following are some key factors to consider when
attempting to locate fronts.

1. *strong temperature gradients*
    -   Fronts generally lie on the warm side of temperature gradients.
        However, beware of diurnal effects, cloudy vs. sunny regions,
        snow cover line, lake effects, etc.

2. *wind shifts*
    -   Winds normally veer with a frontal passage: cold fronts - S
        ahead, NW behind; warm fronts - SE-NE ahead, SE-SW behind,
        stationary fronts -- winds parallel to temperature gradient

3. *troughs in the MSLP field*
    -   Fronts are often found in pressure troughs.

4. *pressure tendencies*
    -   Look for pressure rises behind cold fronts, falls ahead of warm
        fronts

5. *moisture discontinuity*
    -   Drier air behind cold front, moist air ahead of front

6. *upper-air charts*
    -   Look especially for 850 mb temperature gradients.

7. *1000-500 mb* thickness
    -   Thickness is proportional to the mean temperature in the layer.

8. *current weather*
    -   Light to moderate stable precipitation ahead of warm fronts;
        convection ahead of cold fronts.

9. *time continuity*
    -   How is the temperature gradient changing in time?

10. *local/topographic effects*
    -   Wind blowing through river valleys, etc.
