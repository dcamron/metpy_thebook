# Step 1: Draw Contours In Pencil

Begin by drawing your lines in light pencil and then examine
this preliminary analysis.

-  Where are the wiggles that can\'t be justified by the data?
-  Draw in new smoother lines where the wiggles are not justified
   - (consistent with the data of course!).
-  Smooth out any sharp changes in gradients.
-  Even the most experienced synopticians mess up occasionally, so make
   - use of that pencil and eraser.

## Drawing Contours

***How do I draw a contour?** Answer:* Interpolation

When drawing contours of a field (also called isopleths), the
technique of interpolation should be favored over extrapolation. Thus,
a contour is usually placed closer to the data point whose value is
nearer that of the contour ({numref}`Fig. %s <contour_draw_example>`).
However, other factors, such as internal
consistency and the possible presence of inaccurate or 'bad' data
must also be considered. In these cases, an exact interpolation
between data points in your analysis is not always the best way to go.
Particularly in data sparse regions, you should utilize wind
information to help you with your pressure or height analysis.

## Missing Data

***No Data?** Answer:* No contours!

Good synopticians do not extrapolate data contours in large data void
regions (such as the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans on all maps, the Rockies at 850 mb, and underground areas on
isentropic charts), as there is no data there. If the fields you are
analyzing appear coherent and on either side of the data void region,
you may connect your contours through the region using a series of
dots in the appropriate color. This indicates that there is a
significant amount of uncertainty in this area and the dots represent
a rough estimate. But one should be cautious about how you draw any
lines through a data void region.

*Under no circumstances should contours be connected by circling
around the boundaries of a map, over oceans, or other extremely large
bodies of water.*

## Bad Data

***Is the observation bad?***

Be on the lookout for bad data points. If you question a particular
value, check neighboring points. If they are significantly different,
you *may* want to ignore the point. Also examine the same station\'s
data at other available pressure levels. If they are also spatially
inconsistent, you may be visiting Bad Dataville. In problem areas,
look at analyzing the available information several different ways and
then disregard any data point(s) that result in an unrealistic
analysis. Remember, disregarding a data point is a judgment call (as
it may be due to a real process), but your analysis should make sense!

Be acutely aware of the presence of thunderstorms, as their effects
can introduce noise into a synoptic scale analysis. At the surface,
look for thunderstorms, lightning, heavy precipitation, gust fronts,
meso-highs, etc. In synoptic analyses, these effects can often be
treated judiciously as bad data. Remember that thunderstorms often
affect the analysis at several levels.
