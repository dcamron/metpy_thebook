# Map Making Summary

## Summary of process for making a map:**

1.  Open Jupyter Lab

2.  Open an existing or new notebook

3.  Set up all parameters to read data and make a map

4.  Run all cells to generate image

5.  Close and shutdown notebooks when done for the day (cleanup)

Note: You may have multiple `PlotObs()` if you want to layer different
things on the same map before adding them to a panel and a figure.
