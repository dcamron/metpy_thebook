# Upperair Obs and Plotting

At least twice a day, at stations all over the world, radiosondes are launched to
report in situ measurements of temperature and moisture at different 
pressures in order to allow meteorologists to know what atmospheric conditions
are above the surface. As a result of these launches there are a number of
standard plots that are created. The maps represent the quasi-horizontal pressure
surfaces (e.g., 850, 700, 500, 300, 250 hPa) where everywhere on the map
the pressure is the same; however, the height at which the pressure is at
varies greatly. Like the surface station model, we plot a lot of information
around the upper-air station model.
