# What do I have here?

In Linux terminology we want to *list* the contents of the directory,
type `ls` in a terminal window.

`kgoebber@bergeron:~> ls`

When you execute this command you will see the names of all of the
files, directories, and links contained within your working directory.
Is there anything there?

There are several variations on the `ls` command that provide
additional useful information. For example:

`ls -a`: This lists all files and folders...including those that are
hidden

`ls -F`: This lists all files and adds a / to the end of all directories

`ls -l`: This lists all files in "long" format.

`ls -ltr`: This lists all files in the long time reversed order (newest last)

There are a lot more options we can add to a `ls` command. In fact,
there are more than we have time to cover in class.
