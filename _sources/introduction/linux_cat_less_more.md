# What's in a file?

Finally, what if I want to read the contents of a file? Well, there are
a couple of ways to read the file. We'll stick with some of the easy
ways and learn how to write in a file next time. The three easiest ways
to read the content of a file are `cat`, `less`, and `more`.

`cat <filename>`

`more <filename>`

`less <filename>`

Go ahead and cat a file in your directory to see what is contained within it.

:::{note} 
To get out of less or more hit 'q'.
