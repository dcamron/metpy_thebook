# Where am I?

In a text-based environment, it is very important to know where you are,
so how can we find out where we are in a text-based system? Well, there
is a nice and simple command that will print the working directory, type
`pwd`.

`kgoebber@bergeron:~> pwd`

You should see something similar to `/home/kgoebber` where
`kgoebber` is your user name. This is your home directory, where you
will start every terminal session. So now that we know where we are, we
need to know *what* is in this directory.
