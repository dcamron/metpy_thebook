# How do I create/remove a directory?

Now, let's make a directory so that you can keep yourself organized
using a Linux OS. It's really easy to make directories using the command
`mkdir`, for example make a directory called wxtech.

`kgoebber@bergeron:~> mkdir wxtech`

To remove a directory, you first need to empty of the directory of any
files or other directories then use the `rmdir` command to remove the
directory.
