# Jupyter Lab Environment

Since MetPy is a module within the scientific Python ecosystem we will
use Jupyter Notebooks through the Jupyter Lab environment to create our
desired analyses and maps over the course of this book. We'll begin, by
describing the Jupyter Lab environment. To launch jupyter lab on a Linux
system type,

```
jupyter lab
```

When the Jupyter Lab environment opens in your web browser you'll have
two areas in the window: a file browser on the left, and a launcher tab
on the right. The following video describes the Jupyter Lab interface.
Whether you are running it locally or connecting through a JuptyerHub
the structure of the environment will be the same.

Common Keyboard Commands:

> Run A Cell and move to next cell): \<shift\>-\<return\>
>
> Run A Cell and stay on the cell): \<ctrl\>-\<return\>
>
> To Undo Typing in Cell: \<alt\>-z

Cell Types:

-   Code -- executable Python code

-   Raw -- raw text, won't execute

-   Markdown -- formatted text output

It is always best to make a copy of an example notebook to a new
place/name so that you can always get back to the original. If you
copied that notebook to your met130 directory, you'll want to navigate
to that directory in the file browser on the left side of the Jupyter
Lab environment. The notebook will have a small orange icon associated
with the name of the notebook. To launch that notebook simple double
click on that file and it will open the notebook as a second tab in the
right pane.
