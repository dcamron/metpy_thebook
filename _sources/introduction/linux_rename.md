# How do I rename and/or move something?

When you copy something, what was once one are now two. Say instead of
having two instances of a file you just wanted to rename the file.
Without the window view we can't click on an icon and change the name,
we need a program. In Linux this is called a move, such that we are
moving one filename to another filename, the command is `mv`. The `mv`
command requires two pieces of information. For example,

`kgoebber@bergeron:~> mv <current filename> <new filename>`

If you rename a file there will still be only one file, just with a
different name. If you move a file within your directory and you list
the contents of your directory there will no longer be a
file with the old filename, but there will be file new filename.
