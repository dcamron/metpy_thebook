# Where's the manual for this thing?

This brings us to our next command: `man`. `man` is a short for
manual page. If you type `man [command name]` you will receive the
manual pages for that command. Now what about those instances where you
do not know what the command is that you are looking to use. What then?
Well, fortunately, `man` has a built-in search function. To use this,
type `man --K [what you are searching for]` in the command prompt.
This will pull up every manual page containing the word you searched.
Nifty. For a full description of any of the commands and all of the
options (i.e., what the `-a`, `-F`, and `-l` are for the list
command) can be obtained by using the system *manual*.

`kgoebber@bergeron:~> man ls`

This will allow you to see the full documentation on the list command.
Use *man* whenever you need to find out more information about a command
or its uses.
