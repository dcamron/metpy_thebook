# Create Looping GIFs

Often we don't look at a single satellite image, but rather we want to
look at a series of images to see how the atmosphere is changing over a
period of time. There are a number of online tools that can help you
make an animated GIF to have a "loop" of image for a presentation or
website.

Any easy site to use is [ezgif.com](https://ezgif.com/maker) and here is the direct link:
<https://ezgif.com/maker>

Simply browse for the series of images on your local machine, the click
"Upload and make a gif". Once your images have uploaded, you'll be taken
to a page that will allow you some control about how fast your loop will
go and allow you to reorder the images in case they are not in the
desired time order.

*Quality Settings:*

Delay = 100

Last image delay = 250 (or higher)

Loop Count = \<leave empty\>

Once you are satisfied with the animated GIF that you have created you
can make any further refinements through the browser before saving to
your local machine.
