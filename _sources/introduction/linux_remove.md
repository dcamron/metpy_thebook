# How do I remove a file?

But what if I created something and I didn't want it any more, I want to
*remove* it from my file system and never, EVER, be able to retrieve it
again, ever. The command to remove something from you file system is
`rm`. For example, we can delete the test file we renamed,

`kgoebber@bergeron:~> rm <filename>`

**_Be very, very careful with remove as you will NOT be able to recover
any file you remove!_**
