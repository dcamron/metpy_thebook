# Linux Introduction

Many if not all of you are familiar with computers. You have grown up in
an age of computers that are easily accessible. You can surf the web,
stay connected with friends, or play endless hours of video games and
watch YouTube videos. However, few of you have likely used a computer
and its programming capability to answer scientific questions. This chapter
will begin the process of introducing you to the computer as a
scientific tool. Therefore, we will start the process by introducing you
to the Linux operating system (OS).

You can access a Linux terminal through the Jupyter Lab environment through
the "Launcher" page ({numref}`Fig. %s <launchterminal>`).
The Linux (Unix) operation environment has come a long way over the years.
Historically the Linux OS (or its predecessors) was a text-based only
environment, which means that there was no 'Desktop', folder icons, etc.
There wasn't even a mouse! Of course, with no "windows" there was no need.

Since the first computers were so big, and by big I mean literally room-
size or larger, you had a few access terminals (consoles) to log onto
the computer and do the work you needed to do. This terminology lives on
today with the terminal. This chapter will introduce you to the commands
to work within this text-based environment.

While the terminal is the "window" you will be working in, the language
of the terminal is known as the **SHELL**. A shell is a command
interpreter. It basically takes input from the user at the command
prompt and instructs the computer to perform an operation. In other
words, it is a program that allows the user to use the computer without
having to deal directly with the "binary" code the computer uses. Hence
in one sense, we can think of this as a "protective shell" that prevents
the user and the operator from directly communicating with each other.

There are several different **shells** available. Our system is built on
the **BASH** shell. Another common shell is the **TCSH**. While there
are differences between the two shells, the commands that we will be
discussing today will work in both shells.
