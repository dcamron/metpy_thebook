# Introduction

This textbook serves as an introduction to using scientific computing
in Python to analyze and visualize atmospheric data commonly used
in synoptic meteorology. The book is organized into three main sections:
1. a brief introduction with material covering why we currently use
   Python, how to run Jupyter Notebooks, and how to get started using
   Python on your own machines.
2. an introduction to basic use of Python
   including variables, lists, dictionaries, and slicing as well as how to
   run Python scripts, program control elements, and the datetime module;
3. a comprehensive introduction to the declarative syntax that is part
   of the MetPy module with the context of introductory meteorological
   concepts.

Incorporated throughout the text there are links to additional resources
to continue to expand your knowledge of and use of Python in analyzing
and visualizing meteorological data.
